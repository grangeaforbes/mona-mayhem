> Build a retro arcade-style GitHub contribution battle arena with Astro + GitHub Copilot.

**VS Code & GitHub Copilot CLI Workshop**

Turn two GitHub profiles into a fast, playful “scoreboard” experience. This repository is the **workshop starter** and walks you from scaffold to polished UI with agentic workflows in VS Code or the CLI.

*What you'll build by the end of the workshop*

## ✨ Why this project is fun

- **Retro battle vibe**: arcade-inspired UI with playful head-to-head framing
- **Real GitHub data**: compare actual contribution activity between two users
- **Copilot-first workflow**: learn planning, prompting, implementation, and review loops
- **Two learning paths**: choose VS Code or CLI based on how you like to build

## 📚 Workshop

The workshop supports two tracks — follow the one that matches your preferred workflow:

- **VS Code track** — Chat, Plan Mode, Agent Mode, background agents, and editor-native review loops
- **CLI track** — `copilot`, `@file` context, `/plan`, autonomous edits, `/fleet`, `/delegate`, and `/review`
